# Agency Compliance

Agencies are required to perform various tasks in order to satisfy the objectives of the Federal Source Code Policy. Currently, agencies are evaluated on whether they've completed three tasks:

1.  **Updated agency policy**: Agencies must update their policies to be consistent with the Federal Source Code Policy.
2.  **Completed code inventory**: Agencies must inventory all new custom code created after August 2016 (notwithstanding exceptions enumerated in the Federal Source Code Policy).
3.  **Completed open source objective**: Agencies must open source at least 20% of all new custom code created after August 2016.

Agencies are evaluated as fully compliant (green), partially compliant (yellow), or non-compliant (red) with the tasks outlined above. An agency's overall compliance is green only if they are green in all categories.
